## Reflection 
I learned a lot more about setting up the correct enviroment for blockchain development. 
I had to make sure that everything was up to date and working properly.
During the intial setup of ubuntu I had difficulty trying to get the correct version of node and nmp. 
For example, the issues arised durign the installation of hardhat and ganache. 
They both require different versions of node.js and nmp. I had to get two different versions installed and assigne
 them to their respective software. I was. When I was running the program and I had to change the difficulty to make sure that everything was working as expected. 
 I walked though it with difficulty 2 first since 3 was running a bit slow. I broke down the code to  made sure that I understood what each function was doing.
